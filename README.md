# LevelGround-Mockup
This project was good practice in seeing the box-model in action. I used a wireframe as a reference and HTML and CSS.

## How it's made
This site was created with HTML and CSS. Media queries were added at several breakpoints to ensure responsiveness across screen sizes.

## Lessons learned
Making the footer was a challenge. At first I overcomplicated it, but I took a step back to use what I know to create list elements!
